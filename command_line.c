        "Game Overview:\n"
        "  - The goal of Blackjack is to have a hand value closet to 21, without exceeding 21 (busting).\n"
        "  - You start with a balance of $500.\n\n"

        "Gameplay:\n"
        "  1. Place a bet for the current round. The default bet is $100.\n"
        "  2. You will be dealt two cards to start.\n"
        "  3. You can:\n"
        "     - 'Hit' to draw another card.\n"
        "     - 'Stand' to end your turn and keep your current hand.\n"
        "     - 'Split' (if the first two cards are of the same rank) to play two separate hands.\n"
        "     - 'Double Down' to double your bet and receive one more card (not available on splits).\n"
        "  4. The dealer will draw cards until their hand value is 17 or higher.\n"
        "  5. Results are determined based on the following rules:\n"
        "     - Bust: If your hand value exceeds 21, you lose your bet.\n"
        "     - Blackjack: If your initial hand is exactly 21, you win 2.5x your bet.\n"
        "     - 5-Card Charlie: If you draw 5 cards without busting, you win 2x your bet.\n"
        "     - Push: If your hand value matches the dealer's, you get your bet back.\n"
        "     - Higher Value: If your hand value is higher than the dealer's, you win 2x your bet.\n\n"

        "Key Points:\n"
        "  - Aces are worth 11 points but can count as 1 if it helps avoid a bust.\n"
        "  - Face cards (Jack, Queen, King) are worth 10 points.\n"
        "  - Number cards are worth their face value.\n"

        "Commands During Gameplay:\n"
        "  - 'y' or 'n' for yes/no questions.\n"
        "  - Input your bet amount when prompted.\n\n"

        "Ending the Game:\n"
        "  - The game continues until you choose to stop or you run out of balance.\n";
