App name: BlackJack game

Type of app: Integrate C with a GUI to play the game

Our app is recreating the card game BlackJack. The user will be dealt two cards and can decide whether to add another card to their deck. (The player can have two options: stand or draw a card.) The player loses if their hand values are over 21 or the dealer has a higher hand less than 21. The ACE is worth 1 or 11 depending on whether the player exceeds 21. Face cards are worth 10 each. All other cards are worth the number written on the card. The user bets before each game and their overall balance is tracked.
