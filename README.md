App name: BlackJack game
Type of app: Integrate C with a GUI to play the game

Our app is recreating the card game BlackJack. The user will be dealt two cards, and can decide whether to add another card to their deck or not. (The player can have two options: either stand or draw a card.) The player loses if their hand values over 21 or the dealer has a higher hand less than 21. The ACE is worth either 1 or 11 depending on whether the player exceeds 21 or not. Face cards are worth 10 each. All other cards are worth the number written on the card. The user bets before each game and their overall balance is tracked.
