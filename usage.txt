Here’s a breakdown of how to play the Blackjack game:

Basic Setup
1. Blackjack is played with one deck of standard playing cards (one deck has a total of 52 cards).
2. The game has only one player. The dealer is the computer.
3. Number cards (2-10) are worth their face value. Jacks, Queens, and Kings are worth 10 points each, and Aces can be worth either 1 or 11 points.
4. The player is dealt two cards, and the dealer is dealt two cards (one face up and one face down).

Basic Rules
Player Options:
1. Hit: Ask for another card to try to get closer to 21. The player can keep hitting until they choose to stand or go over 21.
2. Stand: The player can Keep their current hand and end their turn.
3. Split: If the player has two cards of the same value, they can split them into two separate hands. They can then place a separate bet on each hand.

Dealer's Turn:
1. The dealer reveals their face-down card and must hit until their hand reaches at least 17.
2. If the dealer's hand exceeds 21, they bust, and the player wins.

Betting
1. If the player enters 0 as their bet amount, it is considered $100 by default.
2. The player cannot enter a negative number as their bet amount.
3. The bet amount must be an integer, not a float or any other type.

Winning
1. If the player does not exceed 21 after having their fifth card in hand, they automatically win. This way of winning is called a Charlie.
2. If the player’s hand is closer to 21 than the dealer’s at any point of the game, the player wins and earns a 1:1 payout. For example, if the player bets $1k, after winning the player earns $2k.
3. If the player gets exactly 21 with your first two cards (a 10-value card + an Ace), this is called “blackjack,” and the player earns 3:2. For example, if the player bets $1k, the player earns $3k.
4. If the player’s hand value exceeds 21, the player "busts" and loses the round automatically.
5. If the player and the dealer have the same hand value, it’s a push, and the player gets their bet back.

Strategy Tips
1. The player should avoid hitting if their hand is 17 or higher, as there’s a high chance of busting.
2. The player should always double down on 11, as the player gets in a strong position to hit a high total.
3. The player should consider splitting pairs of Aces and 8s, but avoid splitting 10s or 5s.
